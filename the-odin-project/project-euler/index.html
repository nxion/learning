  <h1>Project Euler Problems</h1>

  <h2>Probmlem 1</h2>

  <h3>Mutiples of 3 and 5</h3>
  <p> If we list all the natural numbers bvelow 10 that are mutiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these mutiples is 23</p>

  <p>Find the sum of all the mutiples of 3 or 5 below <strong>1000</strong>.</p>

  <h2>Problem 2</h2>

  <h3>Even Fibonacci numbers</h3>

  <p>Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:</p>

  <p>1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...</p>

  <p>By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed <strong>4000000</strong>, find the sum of the even-valued terms.</p>

  <h2>Problem 3</h2>

  <h3>Largest prime factor</h3>

  <p>The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13 and 29.</p>

  <p>What is the largest prime factor of the number <strong>600851475143</strong>?</p>
